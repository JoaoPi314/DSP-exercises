    "As we saw in the **\"DFT Implementation from scracth\"** notebook, the DFT complexity is quadratic. ONce we increase the number of the DFT, the time to compute the result increases drastically. The big idea is: Maybe there is one way that we can cut the complexity to increase performance, while computing the same result. This is achieved by FFT.\n",

    "But first, I will take an approach very different from the usual in our Engineering course. I will take a more mathematical approach to help understand this beautiful algorithm ,then I will try to implement my own FFT. Lets go!"

    "However, the point representation wants to represent the same polynomial with a given number of points. There is one mathematical theorem that says that if we have any polynomial of $n_{th}$ grade, we need $N+1$ points to fully represent it. So, in the case of a polynomial with grade 3 $A(x)$, we need four points to full represent it. So, in order to evaluate, we do:\n",

    "$$Â(k) = 5x_k^3 + 3x_k^2 + x_k + 3$$\n",

    "For each line, we have $4$ multiplications and $4$ additions. Once we have $4$ lines, we need to make $16$ multiplications to fully evaluate the polynomial $A(x)$. If we expand this to an arbitrary $P(x)$ with grade $N$, we will need $N^2$ multiplications, letting us with a problem with complexity of $O(n^2)$. The magic here is there is one way that we can cut this multiplications, and this relays in some beautiful properties. Let's start talking about it"

We had two coefficients to $x^2$ and got two coefficients to $x^4$. Maybe there is one way to assure that every time we square a entire set of data, the new size becomes half of the current size?

I won't write down the equations again, but at this point, we can say that if we square this terms to evaluate $P_e(x^2)$ we will have ${-1, +1}$, right? Now, if we square again to evaluate $P_e(x^4)$, we will have ${1}$. Okay, take a breath, we are almost there! We did the magic of squaring the coefficients two times, and at the end we have a problem of size $4/4$.
